### Guestion 1a: How do I interpert user needs and implement them into a program? 
### Question 1b: How does creating "user stories" help with thi? 

** Answer ** 

I interpret user needs by focusing on the why behind a requested feature, using methods such as stakeholder interviews, direct feedback, and reviewing existing workflows. Understaind the problem a user is trying to solve helps ensure the solution delivers real value rather than just adding functionality. 

User Stories help translate those needs into clear, actionable requirements by framing them from the user's perspective. Using the format "As a user, I want X so that Y" keeps the focus on value instead of technical details, making it easier for the team to prioritize work, estimate effort, and validate that the solution meets user expectations. 

### Question 2a: How do I approach developing programs? 
### Question 2b: What Agile process do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?

** Answer **

I approach development in an iterative way by breaking work into small, manageable pieces and improving the product through regular feedback and testing. This allows issues to be identified early and changes to be made without disrupting the entire project. 

In the future, I want to continue using Agile practices like Continuous integration/ continuous delivery to automate testing and deployment, along with daily stand ups to keep the team aligned and quickly address blockers. 


### Question 3: What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?

** Answer **

Being a good team member means putting the team's success first. This includes communicating openly, taking responsibility for your work, and being willing to help others when needed. 
It also means being respectful during dicussions and code reviews, staying open to feedback, and maintaining a positive collaborative attitude so the team can work effectively together.
