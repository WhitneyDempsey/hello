### Guestion 1a: How do I interpert user needs and implement them into a program? 
### Question 1n: How does creating "user stories" help with thi? 

** Answer ** 
I interpret user needs by focusing on the why behind a requested feature, using methods such as stakeholder interviews, direct feedback, and reviewing existing workflows. Understaind the problem a user is trying to solve helps ensure the solution delivers real value rather than just adding functionality. 
User Stories help translate those needs into clear, actionable requirements by framing them from the user's perspective. Using the format "As a user, I want X so that Y" keeps the focus on value instead of technical details, making it easier for the team to prioritize work, estimate effort, and validate that the solution meets user expectations.
